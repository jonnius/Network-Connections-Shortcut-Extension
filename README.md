### Description: 

Quickly launch Network Connections from the Network Menu. Having to find and launch Network Connections to edit or remove WiFi connections can be pesky, but this should help ease that frustration. This requires nm-connection-editor be installed first if it is not already, to find out if it is installed just run nm-connection-editor from a terminal


### 1 click install from E.G.O:
